# MachineLearning_Projects
This repository includes the the projects that I have done using the Machine Learning algorithms.  

Projects included depicts my skills using different machine learning algorithms, my skills in data wrangling, data visualisation and analysis

<b>1. Data Wrangling And Classifiers</b> This project is done in order to showcase the different preprocessing techniques applied on a train and test dataset visualise and analyse the dataset finally predict the yearly_availability for that particular dataset

<b>2. DeepLearning</b> This project depicts the skills on DeepLearning algorithms using MNIST dataset and also the approaches used to increase the accuracy over the loss by increasing the epochs

<b>3. IRIS_Visualisation</b> This project is basically for learning the different visualisation techniques used in. The dataset considered here is IRIS

<b>4.NLP_Word2Vec</b> During my dissertation work, I have been working on different NLP techniques and word2vec was one of them. More NLP techniques to come

<b>5. PCA_And_Regressors</b> This project includes the understanding of PCA the scree plot to find the number of Principle Components required and the regressor algorithms applied after performing the PCA
